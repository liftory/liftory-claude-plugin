name: digitize-nutrition-plan
description: Copy a nutrition plan or menu that already exists in a document, PDF, photo, screenshot, or pasted text, usually written by a coach, into Liftory for the signed-in user or a client they coach, faithfully and without redesigning it. Use when the user shares a menu document and asks to transcribe, import, digitize, or recreate it in Liftory.

# Digitize a nutrition plan

The user's explicit instructions take priority over this skill. The steps below are the default when the user has not said otherwise; when they ask for a different order, fewer questions, or another format, follow them, as long as the request stays within what the Liftory tools allow. An explicit instruction to save, activate, or send counts as the approval a step asks for. Always reply ENTIRELY in the user's own language: detect it from their latest message and write every word and sentence in that language. Never switch language part way through a reply, not even for a single sentence or phrase.

Read the document yourself: there is no upload tool. When the user describes a document without sharing it, ask them to attach it or paste it.

## Whose menu

Every tool acts as the signed-in Liftory user. Decide whose data the request is about before reading or writing anything:
- The user's own data: call the tools without clientId.
- A client the user coaches: call list_clients, find the client by the name the user gave, and pass that client's clientId. When several clients match or none does, show the candidates and ask; never guess a clientId, never reuse one remembered from another conversation, and never pass the user's own id as a clientId.
- Unclear whether it is for the user or a client: call whoami, which says whether the user coaches clients, and ask only when they do.
- list_clients is empty: the user coaches no one, so only their own data is reachable. Say so instead of looking for the person another way.

## Reading the document

Read the document faithfully. It is the coach's work, and the client will follow exactly what is saved:
- Read every page, image, and table yourself, row by row, before resolving anything. Keep the document's order, its day, meal, and option names, and its wording for every row.
- Copy numbers exactly as written. Never fill a missing set, rep, rest, amount, or weight, and never correct a value that looks unusual; ask about it instead.
- A cell you cannot read, a value cut off at the edge, or a layout that could mean two things is a question for the user, never a guess. Collect these questions and ask them together.
- A blank cell stays blank. Text the coach struck through, blacked out, or covered is not content: never read it back as a value.
- Watermarks, contact details, logos, disclaimers, and page furniture are layout, not content.
- Keep a list of every decision you had to take (an interpretation, a catalog match that is not obvious, a row left without a catalog match) and show it to the user with the transcription.

How a menu maps onto Liftory is in [references/transcription.md](references/transcription.md), and the menu fields are in [references/menu-model.md](references/menu-model.md).

## Steps

1. Decide whose menu it is, as above.
2. Transcribe the document as described above and in the references, and ask the open questions.
3. Find every food with search_food, in the document's language with its language code as the locale, and take the foodId of the food the row names. When there are several plausible matches or none, ask; a row the catalog has no match for stays without a foodId and goes on the decisions list.
4. Build the draft and call validate_nutrition_plan. Fix every unknown foodId and every problem, and validate again until both are empty.
5. Show the transcription meal by meal, the decisions list, and the warnings. Ask the user to approve it, and ask whether it should replace the menu being followed now (which archives the person's other menus) or be saved without activating it.
6. After approval, call create_nutrition_plan with the same draft, clientId when it is for a client, and activate as the user chose.
7. Read the saved menu back with get_nutrition_plan and compare it with the document, meal by meal and line by line. Report every difference; never explain one away.

## Rules

Never invent facts:
- Every id (clientId, planId, exerciseId, techniqueId, foodId, sessionId) comes from a tool result in this conversation, never from memory or a guess.
- Clients, exercises, techniques, and foods are named only as a tool returned them or as the user wrote them.
- Numbers (sets, reps, durations, rest, loads, amounts, calorie and macro targets) come from the user, from their document, or from a design you showed them and they approved. Never state a body weight, a training load, or a target the user did not give.
- When a fact you need is missing, ask for it instead of assuming it.

Writes change a real Liftory account that a coach or client relies on:
- Before any tool that saves, activates, or sends, show the user exactly what will be written and for whom (themselves, or the client by name), and call the tool only after they approve it in this conversation. One approval covers one write.
- Never delete a plan, a menu, or a message, and never ask the user to delete the old version to make room for a new one. A new plan or menu is created next to the old one.
- When a write answers with unknown ids or problems, nothing was saved: fix what it names, show the user what changed, and ask again before the next attempt.

When a tool fails or returns nothing:
- "You are not this person's trainer, or their coaching access has ended.": stop working on that person and tell the user in plain words. Do not retry with another id or as the user's own data.
- "Your Liftory connection was revoked or has expired.": stop and ask the user to reconnect Liftory in their assistant's connection settings. Do not retry until they have.
- A null or empty result means there is nothing there: say so plainly. Never fill the gap with content of your own.
- Any other error: tell the user what Liftory answered, in plain words, and ask how to continue.
