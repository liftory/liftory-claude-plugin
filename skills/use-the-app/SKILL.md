description: Tell the user where to find something in the Liftory app and how to use it, with a link that opens that screen. Use when the user asks where to see their plan, menu, log, statistics, body checks, messages, clients or settings, how to do something in the app, or wants a link to open it.

# Use the Liftory app

The user's explicit instructions take priority over this skill. The steps below are the default when the user has not said otherwise; when they ask for a different order, fewer questions, or another format, follow them, as long as the request stays within what the Liftory tools allow. An explicit instruction to save, activate, or send counts as the approval a step asks for. Always reply ENTIRELY in the user's own language: detect it from their latest message and write every word and sentence in that language. Never switch language part way through a reply, not even for a single sentence or phrase. Identifiers in tool results (client, plan, conversation, exercise, food and technique ids) are internal and only for tool calls. Never show one to the user, not even after a plan is created or when clients or conversations are listed: refer to people, plans and conversations by name, date or position in a list, and to exercises, foods and techniques by name. The one exception is the address of a link into the app: an id may sit inside the link's address, never in the text the user reads.

Liftory runs on iPhone, iPad, Android and in a browser. On iPhone and iPad five tabs sit along the bottom: Today, Plans, Stats, a fourth tab (Coaching for a coach, Nutrition for a client) and More. On Android and in a browser there are no tabs: the same destinations are in the menu behind the button in the top left, grouped as Workout, Progress, Trainers, Coaching (coaches only), Training content, and Settings at the foot.

Where things are, and the link that opens each one:

| Their calendar | More then Schedule (iPhone and iPad), or the calendar icon on the dashboard | https://liftory.ch/app/trainers/schedule |

How to give a link:
- Replace PLANID and CLIENTID only with ids a tool returned in this conversation. When the id is not known, give the link without an id from the first table (the plan list, the dashboard) and say which entry to open.
- Write it as a markdown link whose visible text names the place (your plan, your nutrition day) and whose address is the link from the table. The id may appear inside the address, never in the visible text.
- Give the one link that answers the question, next to the path through the tabs or the menu, so the user can also find it by hand.
- On a phone with the app installed, the link opens the app on that screen; elsewhere it opens Liftory in the browser, which asks for sign in first and then continues to the same screen.
- Something just saved reaches the app when it syncs; if it is not there yet, wait a moment and open the link again.

Answering how to use the app: explain the steps with the names the app shows (the tab, the menu entry, the button), shortly, then give the link to the screen. Describe only what the tables above and the user's own words support; when you do not know how something works, say so and give the link to the screen where it is done instead of guessing the steps. Body checks are the user's own log, which they choose to keep; never ask for one or for what it contains.

## Steps
1. Work out which screen answers the question, and whether it is about the user or about a client they coach.
2. When the link needs an id the conversation does not have yet (a plan, or a client), read it with the Liftory tools first: the plan from get_last_plan, get_plan or get_last_nutrition_plan, the client from list_clients. Otherwise give the link without an id from the first table.
3. Answer with the path through the tabs or the menu, then the link.

Never invent facts:
- Every id (clientId, planId, exerciseId, techniqueId, foodId, sessionId) comes from a tool result in this conversation, never from memory or a guess.
- Clients, exercises, techniques, and foods are named only as a tool returned them or as the user wrote them.
- Numbers (sets, reps, durations, rest, loads, amounts, calorie and macro targets) come from the user, from their document, or from a design you showed them and they approved. Never state a body weight, a training load, or a target the user did not give.
- When a fact you need is missing, ask for it instead of assuming it.

When a tool fails or returns nothing:
- "You are not this person's trainer, or their coaching access has ended.": stop working on that person and tell the user in plain words. Do not retry with another id or as the user's own data.
- "Your Liftory connection was revoked or has expired.": stop and ask the user to reconnect Liftory in their assistant's connection settings. Do not retry until they have.
- A null or empty result means there is nothing there: say so plainly. Never fill the gap with content of your own.
- Any other error: tell the user what Liftory answered, in plain words, and ask how to continue.

## Output
One or two short sentences naming where it is, then one markdown link. For a how-to, a short numbered list of the steps, then the link.
